    <ol>
        <li><strong>Version Control Software:</strong> The tracking and managing of changes made to software code.
            Records changes to files over time so that specific versions later can be recalled. Can allow you to revert
            selected files back to a previous state, revert an entire project back to a previous state, compare any
            changes made over time, see who last modified something, and more.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Add:</strong> The add command is used to add important file contents to the index. You must use the add
            command to add any new or modified files to the index in order to update the index with current content and
            to prepare the content staged for the next commit. Can be preformed multiple times before a commit. Will
            only add content of the specified files at the time the add command is run. This command with committing
            give developers total control over the history of a project without changing how they code/work.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Commit:</strong> The commit command is used to record changes to the repository. For reference, its
            like a captured snapshot of the projects currently staged changes. You will have to explicitly tell Git
            which changes you want to include in a commit before running the 'git commit' command. Use -m to track why you saved a copy of the page.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Push:</strong> Used to update a remote branch (copy of original branch) with the commits made to the
            current branch. You are essentially "pushing" your changes onto the remote. Use when ready to upload, save, or backup files from local computer to the remote repository/folder. This command will only work on files that you 'add' to the local repo and that you 'commit' to the local repo.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Pull/Pull Requests:</strong> This command is used to fetch from and integrate with another
            repository or a local branch. Essentially it will incorporate changes from a remote repository into the
            current branch. For example, if someone had changed code on a separate branch of a project and wants it to
            be reviewed to add to the master branch, they can then put in a pull request. Used to reflect changes
            someone has made in their local environment.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Clone:</strong> Like the name suggests, it will clone a repository into a newly created directory.
            When cloning a repository into another branch, the new branch becomes a remote-tracking branch that can talk
            upstream to its origin branch. The clone will include all the projects files, history, and branches.</li>
    </ol>
